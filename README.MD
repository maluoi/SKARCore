# StereoKit ARCore

This is a very minimal example of using ARCore with StereoKit [based on Nakamir's work](https://github.com/Nakamir-Code/SKARCore/tree/develop) using vanilla StereoKit and recently added features instead of a fork. This is just for pose and AR background, and is not currently robust to rotations or other lifecycle events.
